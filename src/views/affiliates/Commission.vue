    <h1>Commission</h1>
    <p>
      Here at Tournament Affiliates our commission structure is based on the number of first time depositors that you refer to us in any single calendar month.
      We then use a net revenue share model in line with the table below to reward you a percentage of your players losses.
      <br><br>
      Our goal is to generate and develop solid, long term relationships and as we grow, we want you to grow too. Donâ€™t forget that revenue is earned during the lifetime of your players.
      <br><br>
      In addition, if you have any ideas or suggestions we are always open to listen to your specific needs as per your volumes and traffic channels.
