    </p><br><p>The Affiliate agrees and acknowledges that Tournament Entertainment Limited (covering www.tournament.com and any subsequent casino brands launched by Tournament Entertainment Limited) has the right to withhold any payments if such supporting documents are not provided in a timely manner.

    </p><br><p>The acceptance or rejection of the Affiliate’s application to join the Network shall be determined by Tournament Entertainment Limited at its sole discretion.

    </p><br><p>If accepted the Agreement shall commence on the Commencement Date and shall continue until terminated in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.

    </p><br><p>On the Commencement Date Tournament Entertainment Limited shall create an Affiliate Management Area for Affiliate.

    </p><br><p>AFFILIATE PROGRAMME AND CUSTOMER TRACKING

    </p><br><p>Tournament Entertainment Limited shall notify the Affiliate of any news, important updates, bonus changes and promotions sent from time to time by email and by notices posted on the Affiliate Management Area.

    </p><br><p>The acceptance or rejection of the Affiliate’s application to join an Affiliate Programme shall be determined by Tournament Entertainment Limited and the Operator at their sole discretion.

    </p><br><p>If accepted the Affiliate shall be bound by any additional conditions which the Operator may impose from time to time and which will be posted on the Affiliate Management Area.

    </p><br><p>The Affiliate shall place the Link on the Affiliate Site and shall maintain, operate and update the Link in accordance with Tournament Entertainment Limited’s instructions.

    </p><br><p>The Affiliate accepts and acknowledges that any delay or failure to place, maintain, operate or update the Link in accordance with Tournament Entertainment Limited’s instructions may result in referred Customers not being identified and no Commission shall be payable in respect of such unidentified referrals.

    </p><br><p>COMMISSION AND PAYMENTS

    </p><br><p>Commission shall be paid to the Affiliate at the agreed rate as per the tiered commission structure for each Customer who completes an Approved Transaction.

    </p><br><p>Payment of Commission shall be in Euros.

    </p><br><p>The Affiliate shall remain responsible for all bank charges on Commission payments whether in respect of electronic transfers, foreign currency exchange commission, correspondent bank charges, cancelled cheques or otherwise.

    </p><br><p>Tournament Entertainment Limited shall pay Commission on a monthly basis and shall endeavour to do so within 15 days of the end of the month in which the Approved Transaction is completed.

    </p><br><p>Payment of Commission shall be made by electronic transfers to a bank account or accounts of the Affiliate’s choice but Tournament Entertainment Limited shall not be responsible for late payments arising from the Affiliate’s failure to provide accurate or sufficient account information or for any other cause beyond Tournament Entertainment Limited’s reasonable control.

    </p><br><p>No Commission shall be payable in respect of Fraud Traffic or as a result of other unethical or illegal activities by the Affiliate. In such cases, Tournament Entertainment Limited shall be entitled to (i) reclaim Commission it reasonably believes is arising from Fraud Traffic (or to deduct and set-off such Commission against future Commission payments) and/or (ii) suspend payment of any Commission if it suspects that the Affiliate has promoted or listed, or worked with a third party to promote or list, any Tournament Entertainment Limited brand and/or Operator brand on any webpage which uses cookie stuffing, cooking dropping, cloaking techniques and/or forces pop-ups.

    </p><br><p>Affiliates promoting Tournament Entertainment Limited brands will receive commission per deal agreed for each specific brand where applicable. Affiliate is eligible to receive revenue share commission for any new referred player to any of Tournament Entertainment Limited brands which is a result of his marketing efforts when referral is made by the means of his unique tracking code. In the event that an affiliate refers a player who has already registered an account to another website in our network, he/she won’t get paid a CPA for that referral. For clarity, any CPA reward for an individual player will only be paid once which will be on the Tournament Entertainment Limited brand on the network the player joined first.

    </p><br><p>The Affiliate shall be responsible for all taxes payable in respect of the Commission.

    </p><br><p>Tournament Entertainment Limited does not pay VAT on Commission. If the Affiliate wishes or is required to issue invoices to Tournament Entertainment Limited such invoices shall be zero-rated for VAT purposes.

    </p><br><p>No Commission will be payable for revenue generated from player accounts that Tournament Entertainment Limited deem to be fraudulently “linked” to the Affiliate account in any way. This includes staff, family members, agents and associates of the Affiliate and any related entity. If Tournament Entertainment Limited deem the linked account activity to be fraudulent, we reserve the right to withhold funds from both Affiliate and player accounts.

    </p><br><p>Tournament Entertainment Limited reserves the right to set limits for a minimum level of activity on Affiliate’s account aimed to stimulate consistency in the affiliate activity and to encourage affiliate sending new referrals. Such minimum activity levels will be continuously reviewed and Tournament Entertainment Limited reserves the right to cancel any bespoke deals reverting to the standard revenue ladder if an affiliate fails to deliver referrals at the agreed level. Any bespoke commission structures (reward plans) are subject to revision based on performance. Tournament reserves the right to revise or terminate any Hybrid or CPA deal based on affiliate’s performance or if agreed exposure plan is not sustained by the affiliate.

    </p><br><p>The minimum payment is €100 per month. If it is under €100, commission will be rolled over until €100 is exceeded.

    </p><br><p>HIGH ROLLER POLICY

    </p><br><p>The Affiliate’s monthly payable balance of Commission is automatically reset to €0.00 at the beginning of each calendar month, to ensure that no negative balances are carried forward.

    </p><br><p>If in any given month a Customer generates a negative Net Revenue of at least €5,000 he/she will be deemed to be, for the purposes of this section, a ‘High-Roller’.

    </p><br><p>The negative Net Revenue generated by the High-Roller will be carried forward and offset against future Net Revenue generated by that High-Roller;

    </p><br><p>The negative balance carried forward cannot be set-off against other Customer’s Net Revenue;

    </p><br><p>The negative balance of a High-Roller will be reduced by future positive Net Revenue that they generate in subsequent months;

    </p><br><p>A negative balance will not be increased by future negative Net Revenue unless the High-Roller meets the qualifying criteria in subsequent months.

    </p><br><p>The affiliate will be able to view all adjustments in order to track the High-Roller Player’s net breakeven point. Adjustments will be made at the end of each calendar month based on the cumulative revenue for the month running to protect the Affiliate’s income from revenue generated from other Players in the same month.

    </p><br><p>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

    </p><br><p>Tournament Entertainment Limited and the Affiliate grant to each other non-exclusive, revocable, royalty-free licenses to have reasonable use of their respective Intellectual Property for the purposes of this Agreement subject to approval on all external marketing materials.

    </p><br><p>To the extent that it is able to do so Tournament Entertainment Limited also grants to the Affiliate a non-exclusive, revocable, royalty-free license to have reasonable use of the Operator’s Intellectual Property for the purposes of each Affiliate Programme.

    </p><br><p>The licenses granted in these Terms and Conditions are intended to allow Tournament Entertainment Limited and the Affiliate to have reasonable use of Intellectual Property for the purposes of operating the Network but the Affiliate shall not describe itself as being associated with Tournament Entertainment Limited or an Operator in any circumstances without the prior written approval of Tournament Entertainment Limited.
